Welcome to the Chess Program repository! This repository contains a program created in Python for playing chess.

This project is a chess game developed in Python using the Pygame, NumPy, and Unittest libraries. The game is played on a graphical interface built with Pygame, while NumPy is used to handle the game logic and data structures. Unittest is used for testing the game's functionality.

The game has one mode of play which is player versus player.

In order to run the game you need to execute:

    py controller.py

In order to run unit test execute:

    py unit_text.py

Although the game is fully functional, it has some bugs and functions that can be fixed to improve the user experience.
