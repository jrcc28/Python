Welcome to the Python Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects in Python as a part of my portfolio.

Each project is contained in its own directory with a README file that provides a brief overview of the project and how to run it. Some projects may also include additional documentation or a requirements.txt file listing any required Python packages.

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine and browse the directories to find a project that interests you. You can then follow the instructions in the README file to run the project.

Thank you for visiting this repository and we hope you find these Python projects useful and informative!
